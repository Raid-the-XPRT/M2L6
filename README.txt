This is a folder containing all complete codes of task1 through task4 all working perfectly!

in order to use the Makefile, simply make task# (make task4), it will compile all tasks and run that particular task

or you can simply (make) to run all the tasks one by one

in case you want to delete all the compiled files, simply run make clean


NOTE: ALL TASKS ARE WOKRING FINE, IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY ISSUES PLEASE CONTACT ME FIRST
